# dcs-bios-sketches
My repo of public code examples/samples, for use with [DCS: World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/), the combat flight simulator game, and with [dcs-bios](https://github.com/dcs-bios/dcs-bios), an add on application that allows hardware to communicate bi-directionally with the game. (There's also a [fork of dcs-bios called DCSFlightpanels](https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels/dcs-bios) that these examples may or may not work with).  dcs-bios is one way people build entire cockpits that look and behave like real fighter jets and helicopters.

My setup has grown over the years, but all sits on, by or attaches to my desk to play,

and can all be moved into the closet for the normal workday. Almost every button and switch you see is hooked up in game

# What is here so far (this is what you're here for!)
1) [ARC210](./arc210/) - my psuedo-ARC210 radio implementation
2) [external lights](./externallights/) - one of the simplest possible examples, driving some leds

## Maybe coming soon?
I have some other smaller test things i did that may or may not be interesting to anyone?

## License!
Everything in this repo is available under the MIT license (See [LICENSE](./LICENSE)), though if you *DO* use it for commercial purposes for heaven's sake do 2 things:
1) review the code thoroughly and make it production quality.  It works well enough for me, but i personally wouldn't sell it as is
2) give back to the community if you make money using it!
