# dcs-bios-sketches
My repo of public dcs bios examples/samples, for use with DCS, the computer combat flight simulator, and with DCS-BIOS, an add on application that allows hardware to communicate bi-directionally with the game.

## What is here so far
1) [ARC210](./arc210/) - my psuedo-ARC210 radio implementation
2) [external lights](./externallights/) - one of the simplest possible examples, driving some leds

## Maybe coming soon?
I have some other smaller test things i did that may or may not be interesting to anyone?

## License!
Everything in this repo is available under the MIT license (See [LICENSE](./LICENSE)), though if you *DO* use it for commercial purposes for heaven's sake do 2 things:
1) review the code thoroughly and make it production quality.  It works well enough for me, but i personally wouldn't sell it as is
2) give back to the community if you make money using it!
